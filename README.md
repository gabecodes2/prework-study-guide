# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

My movitvation was to expand my knowledge of coding. The Ins and outs of web development on the basic scale.
I built this to have an accurate study guide for my bootcamp but also to understand the fundementals of HTML, CSS and what web coding in this bootcamp will be like.
This webpage gives me a study guide with some key points in each field of coding.
I learned what goes into making a website, how 1 wrong code can stop you in youre tracks, but at the same time 1 right code can do so much.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
